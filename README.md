Bitmap Font API & Tools
===========

**This is an API and Tools to aid in use of custom Xeekworx Bitmap Fonts in games.**

You'll want to build freetype2 in the third-party directory before the xwfont_library & xwfont_generator projects can be built. I've created a Visual Studio 2017 configuration in the freetype build/windows folder.
